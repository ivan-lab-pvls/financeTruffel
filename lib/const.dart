          "Deutsche Bank has promoted a fixed income veteran to lead its business in the UK and Ireland, replacing Tiina Lee who left for Citigroup earlier this year.\n\nVathany Vijayaratna is now chief executive for the UK and Ireland at the German lender, it said in a statement announcing her appointment. A 2o-year veteran of Deutsche, she was previously global head of structuring within its fixed income and currencies division, and was most recently head of non-financial risk for its investment bank.\n\nVijayaratna takes the role from Lee, who has now made the switch to lead Citigroup's UK operations after her appointment was announced in July. Lee takes charge of 15,000 UK employees at Citigroup, having spent 26 years at Deutsche Bank, five leading its UK and Ireland operations.",

The Westport, Connecticut-based company operates 450 veterinary clinics and hospitals across the US and has been owned by private equity giant KKR since 2018. It has been a successful acquisition, but the company is facing a wall of debt maturities that can only be refinanced at higher cost. KKR is providing \$600m of additional equity to ease the burden, while private debt lender Blue Owl Capital will extend PetVet a \$2.3bn senior loan.",

      subtitle:
          'Day trading means buying and selling a batch of securities within a day, or even within seconds. It has nothing to do with investing in the traditional sense. It is exploiting the inevitable up-and-down price movements that occur during a trading session.\n\nDay trading is most common in the stock markets and on the foreign exchange (forex) where currencies are traded.\n\nDay traders are typically well-educated in the minutia of trading and tend to be well funded. Many of them add an additional level of risk by using leverage to increase the size of their stakes.',

      subtitle:
          "The profit potential of day trading is an oft-debated topic on Wall Street. Internet day-trading scams have lured amateurs by promising enormous returns in a short period of time.\n\nSome people day-trade without sufficient knowledge. But there are day traders who make a successful living despite—or perhaps because of—the risks.\n\nMany professional money managers and financial advisors shy away from day trading. They argue that, in most cases, the reward does not justify the risk. Moreover, many economists and financial practitioners argue that active trading strategies of any kind tend to underperform a more basic passive index strategy over time especially after fees and taxes are taken into account.",

There are software packages that help create charts and graphs for the purpose.\n\nThe day trader also must have a plan in place before making a single trade.
